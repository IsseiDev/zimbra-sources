Zimbra-Source Mirror\
====================\
\
This is an unofficial mirror of the VMware Zimbra Perforce Repository on GitHub.\
\
As I find Perforce rather quirky and slow, I thought about mirroring the sources on the far more intuitive and lean GitHub.\
\
Thanks to the guys at Zimbra and GitHub for letting me do this.\
\
Please note the following:\
\
**This repository is not connected to Zimbra or VMware in any way. Please don't ask for support about this repository. Don't send pull requests, because they won't be accepted anyway.**\
\
**Additionally, please note all licenses in this repository. This really is only a mirror of the main repository.**}
