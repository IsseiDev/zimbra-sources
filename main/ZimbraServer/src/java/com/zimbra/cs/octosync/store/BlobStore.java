/**
 * Abstract interface representing generic storage of blobs.
 *
 * This interface is currently used for storing Octopus patches only. It provides
 * simplest layer of abstraction with the functionality required for storing, retrieving and
 * deleting patch files. It is to be implemented using existing blob storage
 * facilities such as StoreManager. In the future, as we modernize the storage back-end
 * this API may evolve into widely used general purpose API. For the time being, it
 * just remains the glue between patch storage and the existing storage facilities.
 *
 * The key idea in this API is that incoming blobs are distinguished from stored blobs.
 * Incoming blob is a blob that is being received, and is possibly not yet complete.
 * It can be appended to as the data is being received. This supports resumable uploads.
 * Once complete, it can be turned into stored blob. An incoming blob that never got stored
 * should be automatically purged.
 *
 * Incoming blobs are assigned ids by the store. Stored blobs use user supplied ids.
 * Namespaces for both types are separate. Additionally stored blobs support versioning.
